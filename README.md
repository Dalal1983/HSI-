# HSI-
hyperspectral image classification
these are the implementation of different models used for hyperspectral image classification 
here i have implementated 4 models for HSI(hyperspectral image classification) which are 
1)HSI_ANN (Artificial Neural Network model)
2)HSI_SVM (Support vector machine)
3)HSI_MLP (MLP classifier)
5)HSI_LSTM (Long short term memory its an RNN model)

SVM is good but svm is not good for big datasets like PAVIA 
so for best performance i suggest use LSTM it is good for both small datasets like India_pinse as well as good for big datasets like PAVIA
